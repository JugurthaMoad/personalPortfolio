       Bonjour! My name is Jugurtha Moad, and I am <span className="tech">front-end</span> developer with an interest in back-end development based in France. With extensive experience in cutting-edge technologies like <span className="tech">ReactJS</span>, <span className="tech">React Native</span>, and <span className="tech">NodeJS</span>, I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet the needs of my clients.
<br /> <br />
When I am not busy building innovative apps and websites, you can find me exploring the beautiful French countryside on my bike, or curled up with a good book on personal development. 
As a musician, I also enjoy playing guitar to relax and unwind. 
<br />
<br />
My love of personal development and music has taught me the importance of creativity, communication, and collaboration - qualities that I bring to every project I work on.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I am excited to connect with new collaborators and continue pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the world of technology.
